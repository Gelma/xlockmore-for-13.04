== Whatta? ==

In Ubuntu 13.04 ( http://www.ubuntu.com they ) they removed xlock ( http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/xlockmore.html ).

I was sad, so I recompiled the latest version (5.42) for it.

It's a quick&dirty repackaging. I committed everything here so others can check the final packages and the sources I used.

It works on my machine, it doesn't mean it will work for you.

Anyway, write to me if you need: andrea.gelmini@linux.it

Ciao,
Andrea
